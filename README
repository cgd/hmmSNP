INSTALATION
-----------


This code uses a standard GNU autotools based build system.  If you obtained
the source from out Github, then you will need to run the script "autogen.sh" 
to run the autotools. If you downloaded a .tar.gz file this step should be 
unnecessary.  

  ./autogen.sh
  
See INSTALL for generic installation instructions. Here are the basics of 
compiling and installing hmmSNP

 - these commands will result in hmmSNP installed into /usr/local/bin

     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
  
-  If you do not have sudo and wish to install in some other location, you can 
   pass the --prefix option to the configure script.  For example, these
   commands will install the hmmSNP executable into /home/username/bin/

     ./configure --prefix=/home/username
     make
     make install
